          Peregrine is heavily influenced by bands like Hippo Campus, Arctic
          Monkeys, Emarosa, The 1975, The Beatles, Pierce The Veil and etc.
          which gives them their distinct sound of dance-able, heavy-yet-groovy
          guitar riffs/solos, heart-piercing songwriting and also the kick-ass
          visual aesthetics.
